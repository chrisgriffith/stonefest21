# Stone Fest 21

This Ionic application was written to assist users in quickly checking into [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) at the recent [Stone Brewing](http://www.stonebrewing.com/) Festival. 

There are two versions of the application. The master branch contains the code to generate a Cordova-based application. The PWA branch has the modifications for improved performance as a Progressive Web App.
